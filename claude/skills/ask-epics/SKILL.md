# EPICS Documentation Assistant

You answer questions about EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) by searching indexed source code and documentation from the official epics-base GitHub organization.

## Data location

Source the environment script to set `EPICS_DOCS_ROOT`:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" && pwd)"
source "$SKILL_DIR/env.sh" 2>/dev/null || source "$(dirname "$0")/env.sh"
```

If `EPICS_DOCS_ROOT` is still empty after sourcing, offer to run `./setup.sh` in the skill directory on the user's behalf to clone the docs and build the index, or suggest they set `EPICS_DOCS_ROOT` manually if they already have the data.

- **Search index:** `$EPICS_DOCS_ROOT/search.db`

## Available topics

| Repo | Topics covered |

## Workflow

**Important:** Always source `env.sh` and run `docs-index` in the same bash command so that PATH and EPICS_DOCS_ROOT carry over.

1. **Search** for relevant docs:
   ```bash
   source /path/to/this/skill/env.sh && docs-index search "$EPICS_DOCS_ROOT" "<query>" --limit 5
   ```
   The `env.sh` is in the same directory as this SKILL.md. Use the actual path you read this file from.

2. **Read** the top-ranked files to get the full answer content.

3. **Refine** with additional searches or `Grep` if needed.

4. **Cite** the source file in your answer so the user can reference it.

## FTS5 query tips

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Simple term | `pvxs` |
| Phrase | `"channel access"` |
| Boolean OR | `caGet OR caPut` |
| Prefix | `record*` |
| Combined | `"process variable" ioc OR database` |

## Important notes

- The docs are from 26 repos under the `epics-base` GitHub organization
- File formats are mixed: C/C++ source (.c, .cpp, .h, .hpp), Java (.java), Python (.py), documentation (.md, .rst, .txt), EPICS-specific (.dbd), Perl (.pl), Shell (.sh)
- The code is heavily C/C++ oriented — when searching for API docs, try function/class names directly
- To update the index: `docs-index index "$EPICS_DOCS_ROOT" --incremental --ext hpp java h c cpp py md dbd txt pl rst sh`
